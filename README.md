# NASA Exoplanet Mass Prediction
This notebook predict Mass of a exoplanet using NASA Exoplanet Archive data

# How to Open this Project
Check this video to run all my project:

i made 5 project of building a new model and comparing it to a bunch of other traditional model

i have already proved that i didnt cheat , all the project uses different architecture and dataset

in short its Prediction System but in dept all the projects are unique and follows different architecture
my project required high end GPU and TPU in order to use this as a backend to a webapplication
but athena awards required a webapp as a playable link so for that i created webapp which uses traditional model for all the project

my system uses intel i3 3rd gen with no graphic card so i technically rely on online gpu like google colab

My work flow will be like I will develop my code locally using vscode do  trail and local run like running with very low data or compact constraints , then copy and paste those code on google colab and I make them run simultaneously on google colab and continue building on vscode My raw code -> runs on vscode -> runs on google colab -> I will run a code alignment and code format in google colab and in vscode -> if it passed all the steps and I feel like the code is good then I will push that code to github as I am adding new feature to it { you also mentioned in
athena award to commit when you add new feature to the code }

so ai i used are code prettier extension in vscode and google colab default ai for code alignment

my total hours recorded in hackatime is 237hrs but they approved only 35 { 7 hrs in each project }

its my 2 months of hardwork and the whole point of hack club is to learn right if they approve 7hr per project then i would have increased project count and reduced hours but does it mean that i work for artifacts and not learning

i am too lasy so used all readme as same
